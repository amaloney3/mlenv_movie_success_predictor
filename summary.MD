Overview of Presentation Graphs Branch activity

This branch focuses on exploratory analysis and presentation visuals. The first several commits included code to explore and summarize the IMDB and TMDB data before clean-up.
It also included code for correlation matrices and other summaries of the merged and cleaned data to begin the feature selection process.
Finally, Resources and Images folders were added so the each of the Python notebooks could be used, and each of the individual images used in the shareholder update and final
presentation would be accessible.

This branch will ultimately be merged with the main branch.
