## GitHub
With the main reposititory residing on Andrew's account, I have stepped in to assist the team with the responsibilities of updating our individual branches and the main branch throughout the final project segmentation. This includes providing the team with an outline of steps required to successfully work in tandem within individual branches on our repository:
1) create a new branch in command line with “git checkout -b Branch_Name”
2) “git pull origin main”
3) do what you gotta do but before you are done for the day, git add/commit/push
4) when you start a new working session, “git pull origin main” to get any new updates
5) when you finish, git add/commit/push to your branch
6) start a pull request
7) send a note to us to review your request once Andrew adds us as reviewers

When it comes time to merge our respective branches, I am leading the conversation and helping team members walk through the steps involved to update the main branch with our latest and greatest. I have also been helping team members individually trouble shoot as conflicts arise, with support from Sam in office hours.

## Project Management
Within team meetings, I am typically managing the meeting with kick-off, request for agenda topics, managing the agenda, task master and time keeping. Fortunately, this has been a very easy job with a highly engaged team that is clear on what our priorities are and have been diligently working well within the confines of the time we have to work collaboratively. 

In addition to meetings during our usual class time, we meet 1-3 additional times as a whole team, supplemented by individual working sessions. I am often tapped to help with feedback, technical trouble shooting, or GitHub topics.

## Stakeholder Update
During the final project segment 2, a stakeholder update was requested. I prepared the content and provided the team with an update based on the requirements outlined in our last class before the stakeholder update is due. 

## Presentation Blueprint
Our final presentation blueprint is a first draft at our final presentation with the format and style of the presentation determined. Also, the overall flow has been defined, starting with introduction to our topic and the reason we selected it, followed by a listing of the team members and roles, an explanation of the question(s) we are looking to answer, and an introduction to fictional stakeholders who would benefit from our good work. 

For the time being, our presentation has the beginnings of our story regarding the data clean up effort involved in this work. Unfortunately, our dataset required far more effort to prepare it for use in further data analysis and thus, we have not yet identified many of our analysis conclusions. However, we have started a dashboard blueprint to help tell the story of the clean up involved and how we were able to extract, transform and prepare the data for loading into the database. 

Our next steps for the presentation will be to continue to develop the visuals and add our conclusions in parallel with the creation of an interactive dashboard. Currently, the presentation is in Google Slides format, which does not readily reside on GitHub as it is web based. It had quite a few iterations in Google Slides before I was able to add some PDF exports to GitHub until I finally discovered the ability to download as a PowerPoint that could be loaded to my Presentation_MA respository. 

## Dashboard Blueprint
In partnership with Andrew, I created the blueprint draft of our interative dashboard. Andrew had discovered a library that allowed us to really dig into understanding our original datasets using a Profile Report. We were able to capture many of the graphs and images from this report and place them as placeholders throughout our dashboard. We called out which of these are good candidates for creating Tableau interactive graphs and have prepared our blueprint in Google Slides format, so that we can determine how to best transition in the upcoming segment to a Tableau version.
