# Can We Forecast Film Success? Cinema and Machine-Learning

## Topic
Everyone loves movies -- or, at least has an opinion about them. And since cinema has recently been reshaped by the rise of streaming and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've set out anew to understand what makes them work. Using data-wrangling skills in Python, and machine-learning skills from packages such as scikit-learn, we plan to answer: What makes movies successful? And how should success be defined?

## Data
We plan to use multiple datasets to aid our inquiry, from sources such as The International Movie Database (IMDb) and The Movies Database (TMDB). The former has compiled data on movie plots, critic and user reviews and ratings, and awards; the latter includes variables such as cast and crew, budgets and box office returns. Additional data, from from sources such as Kaggle, will also be included.
