## Final Presentation Tweaks
This branch focused on final adjustments before the final project is presented and turned in. That included:
-Checking and double-checking the Tableau dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/am5877/viz/movie_success_predictor_graphs/Dashboard1?publish=yes) for functionality
-Final decisions on edits (e.g. Including images of modeling process/trying to add hover-over effects to 'Genres' chart)
-Updating final script for the presentation.
